# Company Brand Messaging Playbook (Internal)

## 1. Purpose & Usage
- This document is an internal copy system for development, deck updates, sales messaging, and outreach execution.
- All language is evidence-first and anchored to the public websites listed in Section 6.
- Use this playbook to keep every company voice authoritative, industry-appropriate, and consistent across channels.
- This is not legal advice. Compliance wording here is a messaging baseline and should be reviewed against current counsel and platform policy before publication.

## 2. Global Voice Rules
### Tone Baseline
- Be direct, operational, and commercially clear.
- Lead with outcomes and process discipline, not hype.
- Avoid unverified superlatives or claims that cannot be publicly supported.

### Evidence Standard
- If a numeric or operational claim is not visible on listed public sources, do not present it as fact.
- Prefer phrasing like "positions itself as," "public site presents," and "published services include" when citing public marketing language.

### Writing Rules
- Use plain language with strong verbs.
- Keep copy modular so teams can reuse blocks in web, deck, ads, and outbound.
- Prioritize reader utility: who it is for, what problem it solves, what action to take next.

### Cross-Channel Consistency
- Keep each brand aligned to one primary market identity.
- Reuse approved value pillars and proof lines before creating new messaging.
- Match CTA intensity to buying stage: awareness, evaluation, or conversion.
