# Bosque Operations Brief

## A) What This Business Is

- Regulated cannabis transportation and delivery operation with account-management and recruiting components.
- Built for high-friction logistics/compliance environments where execution reliability matters.
- Revenue model is operational and contract based, not software-license based.
- Expansion depends on route volume, account depth, and staffing capacity.
- Existing repository context indicates prior real-world operations, but local proof files are currently missing.

## B) How Money Is Made

- **Transport contracts**: `Collected Revenue = (Trips or route volume) × (contracted rate)`.
- **Delivery/dispatch execution**: `Collected Revenue = completed deliveries × agreed service price`.
- **Account expansion**: `Incremental Revenue = added routes + stacked services + OTR scope`.
- **Recruiting support (if active)**: `Collected Revenue = placement/managed labor fees`.

## C) Operating Flow (Lead → Close → Deliver → Expand)

1. Lead intake from operators or referrals.
2. Qualification for route need, compliance fit, and service scope.
3. Close with commercial terms + compliance/operating alignment.
4. Deliver dispatch/transport services and collect invoices.
5. Expand through added routes, additional locations, or broader operating windows.

## D) Proof Anchors

- `Agents.md` Bosque section confirms business vertical and operating framing.
- Bosque invoice and process PDFs are expected but not present in repository (see `docs/MISSING_FILES.md`).

## E) Roles

### Executive Account Manager (sales + lead gen)

- Owns pipeline creation, discovery, pricing alignment, and close.
- Maintains account communication and identifies expansion opportunities.

### Recruiter (if applicable)

- Applicable when Bosque is actively recruiting drivers/operators.
- Builds candidate funnel, qualification, and placement into routes.

### Management/Coaching

- Supports dispatch quality, process adherence, and route optimization coaching.

## F) Lead Gen + Closing Playbook

1. Prospect licensed operators and route decision-makers.
2. Run discovery: lane needs, timing, compliance constraints, pain points.
3. Present operational fit + service package.
4. Negotiate rates/terms and confirm execution constraints.
5. Execute agreement and hand off to dispatch onboarding.
6. Run first delivery cycle with check-ins.
7. Conduct post-close review and propose expansion scope.

## G) How Results Are Measured by Role

### Executive Account Manager

- **Qualified operator opportunities/week**: prospects with verified compliance fit, route demand, and buying authority.
- **Contract close rate**: percentage of scoped opportunities converted into signed transport agreements.
- **First-invoice cycle time**: days from signed contract to first collected invoice.
- **Account expansion rate**: percentage of active operators that add routes, stops, or broader service windows.

### Recruiter (if active)

- **Compliance-ready candidate yield**: candidates passing licensing/document checks and route-readiness screening.
- **Time-to-fill critical routes**: days required to staff high-priority lane openings.
- **30-day route retention**: percentage of placed operators still active after first month.

### Management / Dispatch Oversight

- **On-time execution rate**: completed pickups/drop-offs within contracted windows.
- **Incident-free completion rate**: completed moves without compliance, safety, or chain-of-custody exceptions.
- **Gross margin per route cycle**: collected route revenue minus direct route operating cost.
