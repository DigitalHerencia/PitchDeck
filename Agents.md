High-level portfolio snapshot (from your existing context)
Bosque Ltd

Vertical: Cannabis transportation, delivery, recruiting, sales, account management
Stage: Previously operational (you’ve referenced real licensing and real clients in earlier discussions)
Core leverage you already have:

Regulated market access (hard gate, high friction for new entrants)

Operational know-how in:

dispatch

compliance flow

real-world logistics

Revenue is transaction-based and contract-driven (B2B / operators)

Expansion vector = people + routes + contracts (not R&D)

This is a real-world operations business, not a speculative software play.

Digital Herencia LLC

Vertical: “Data cartel” + indie software studio for SMBs
Positioning: Sales + customer acquisition first, software second
Core leverage you already have:

You are not selling generic SaaS — you are selling:

revenue enablement

lead generation

internal tooling that supports selling

You already operate:

spec-driven development

automation pipelines

modern stack (Next 15 / Prisma / Clerk / server actions, etc.)

The studio is intended to become:

a repeatable production engine

not a one-off agency

This is a productized revenue infrastructure studio, not a dev shop.

Next Gen Management Co

Vertical: Creator/talent management optimized for OnlyFans + LoyalFans
Growth channels: Reddit, Twitter/X, Telegram
Audience: recruiters, managers, operators (not creators themselves)

Core leverage:

Funnel-first thinking

Off-platform acquisition (very important in adult/creator economy)

You’re designing:

lead capture

creator qualification

manager workflow

retention & monetization ops

This is a performance marketing + operations platform wearing a talent-management brand.

What you are really building (unifying frame)

All three businesses share a single spine:

You build revenue machines in messy, high-friction markets where charisma + survival intelligence beats credentials.

That framing matters for partner psychology.

You are not pitching:

code

dashboards

features

You are pitching:

control of income

access to opportunity

systems that turn street-level hustle into repeatable money

Deck architecture philosophy (applies to all three)

These decks must:

read in under 7 minutes

have no technical depth

visually emphasize:

money flow

people flow

deal flow

remove academic language entirely

Your partner persona:

high social capital, low institutional patience, high pattern recognition, very sensitive to bullshit.
